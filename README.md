I have created a Banking Demo Spring Boot RESTful API Application from scratch to revise my core Spring Boot concepts and to implement new features hands-on.

So far, I have implemented:
- RESTful APIs
- DTO and Mapper Layer
- Customized HTTP Status Codes
- Custom Exceptions
- Global Exception Handling

I am planning to enhance the application further with the following concepts:
- PUT vs PATCH API design
- Custom API responses
- Spring Boot Actuator
- Centralized logging
- Caching
- Transaction management
- Spring Security
- JWT Authentication
- API testing through Swagger
- Unit Testing
- Docket setup
- Deployment on AWS
- JUnit5 and Mockito (TDD)

Maintain the same codebase on Github
